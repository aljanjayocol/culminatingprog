        <h2>My Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            When I was in daycare and during grades 1 to 3, I often went home with 5-star rewards on my hand.<br>
            When I graduated from elementary school, I received titles such as Honor Student and Model Student.<br>
            I completed high school from grades 7 to 10 with perfect attendance and graduated with honors.<br>
            In my first year at EdSci, I was also recognized as a model student for three straight quarters and maintained honor status.<br>
            Additionally, I was elected as the Secretary of the Library Organization.
